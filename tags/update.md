**Port Info:**
You can view Create's currently supported versions [here](<https://github.com/Creators-of-Create/Create/wiki/dev.status>) and also see the current state of porting work.

**Update Info:**
It'll be ready when it's ready. We appreciate that you are excited for the next release, but you'll have to let us get back to you when the time comes.
Giving out dates puts pressure on development, and will ultimately lower the quality of our content due to deadline induced measures.
You can follow our project here or on CurseForge to receive notifications for an update.
